The Non-Standard Library
========================
This package is basically my personal collection of utility functions.  They 
touch on text processing, stdout manipulation, class and function decorators, 
debugging output, and things like that.  If you find these functions useful and 
would like to add some of your own, feel free to open a pull request.  I'm 
always happy to have more useful 2-liners!
